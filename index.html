                The field of Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded rapidly and now smart things have been deployed in schools, homes, and cities. In this project, we examine developing an IoT robot that is faster and more efficient than many existing solutions and versatile enough to be deployed in multiple scenarios and achieve its intended function. A Terasic hexapod spider robot will be used with its DE0-Nano system on chip (SoC) board to implement an IoT robotics system.

                In this system, computer vision applications will be demonstrated, in this case shape recognition by a machine learning classifier. Some parts of the data will be processed on the board to provide real-time interaction of the robot with the surrounding environment while other parts will be sent to the cloud to be stored or further processed and analyzed. Computer vision will be used to recognize shapes and react accordingly. For that to be done, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part is programmed to handle the movement of the robot. On the other side, the Hard Processor System (HPS) handles the shape recognition along with connectivity including WIFI and Bluetooth communication. The solution described above can be used in many real-life scenarios.

                One of the main contributions of this project is also in that it offers IoT capabilities to a robot using its SoC platform. This system demonstrates the wide possibilities of developing computer vision applications on robots that utilize SoC platforms. With the many peripherals of this system it can support a wide array of applications in sensing or computer vision. The system we developed has many connectivity capabilities a successful implementation of shape recognition algorithms on the DE0-Nano-SoC board to automate the movement of the spider.
